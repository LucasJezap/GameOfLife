 * Simple implementation of CoordinatePoints class denoting a set of points on a 2d grid. The points are given in
 * (x,y) form. It's main use is to store the coordinates of all currently alive cells in the game.
 * It's naively implemented by two arrays of same length denoting rows and columns coordinates.
 * It's running time is O(n^2) where n is the number of rows/columns (the game is on square 2d grid).
 * However, given our limitations for row and column sizes we can effectively treat it as constant time (O(1)).

 * The rules of the Game of Life:
 * 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
 * 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
 * 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
 * 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
